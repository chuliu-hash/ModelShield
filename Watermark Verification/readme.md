# Watermark Detection

This directory contains scripts for detecting watermarks in text generated by potentially suspicious models. Two levels of detection are provided: rapid detection for quick assessment and detailed detection for in-depth analysis.

## Scripts

### 1. **`rapid.py`**
- **Purpose**: Performs rapid watermark detection.
- **Inputs**: 
  - Text suspected to be generated by a imitation model.
- **Process**:
  - Calculates the watermark score for the suspected text.
  - Compares this score against a threshold derived from human-generated text using a t-test.
- **Usage**: Ideal for quick checks to identify possible watermark presence.

### 2. **`detailed.py`**
- **Purpose**: Conducts detailed watermark detection.
- **Inputs**:
  - Text suspected to be generated by a imitation model.
  - Suspected model's base architecture.
  - A legitimate model trained on non-watermarked data using the same base architecture.
- **Process**:
  - Performs two KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) tests:
    1. Compares the watermark scores of the suspected model's outputs against the base model's outputs.
    2. Compares the watermark scores of the suspected model's outputs against the legitimate model's outputs.
  - Provides a comprehensive assessment to determine if the suspected model is an imitation model.
- **Usage**: Suitable for thorough verification and deeper analysis of watermark presence.

## Notes
- **Rapid Detection**: Lightweight and efficient for quick evaluations.
- **Detailed Detection**: Requires access to the base and legitimate models but offers more robust verification.
- Both methods aim to distinguish between legitimate model outputs and imitation models trained with watermarked data.
